I give you an array of 51 cards. Each card contains two properties: the suit, and the title (a string of either a number or a ranking: king, ace, so on).
Fifty-two cards form a deck. But I gave you 51. One is missing! How do you find it?
Try to come up with the most efficient steps to solve this.
Hint: Using a for loop against an array of values is not the most efficient solution--what if the cards aren't sorted?



var cards= [];
var suit;
var title;
.includes- indexof


1. create two arrays
for(allCards)
if(givenCards.indexof(allCards[i])===-1)
2.Create a for loop
3. We loop through the array to see if matches the element that's missing
4. If it is not the element continue looping to find the element that matches the missing element
